# Team Green - Jordan Bert Jeff Carlos

## Cooperation Plan

## Jordan

- Very flexible
- Open to communication
- Enjoy JS and backend coding

"I'm very open to communicating and exchanging ideas, and I'm quite flexible in accepting what role to take in a group. This makes me a great team player."

"My curiosity can drag me down unnecessary "rabbit holes". My thoughts sometimes tunnel, focusing on some details while filtering others. This can cause me to miss the mark on a topic or project. It would help if I can learn to stay on task more."

"In line with what Carlos said, we need to brief before we begin everyday to asses where we are at. After every couple hours, we can regroup and check on any updates and progress of the project."

## Carlos

- Present and focused
- Eliminate distractions
- Solicit input and feedback from team
- UML and big picture mapping

"With the big picture requirents I look forward to utilizing the AGILE principles to complete the project. I can keep us organized and distraction free."

"I want to work on my technical skills, time management, and seeking help within a good time frame."

"We want to start the day with a focused briefing of tasks recently completeled, tasks that need to be completed urgently, and what the final goal tasks consists of at that time."

## Jeff

- Always ask questions
- Learn from teammates
- Can read body language and non verbal cues
- Avoid placing blame
- Clear communicator
- Express gratitud
- Recognize team achievements
- Good and HTML and CSS

"I can keep the group organized and on track with my interpersonal skills."

"I want to be more of an extrovert. I want to develop the ability to come out of my shell and talk and collaborate with my team members without hesitation."

"We should talk about the conflicts in your tasks that you're having that are keeping you from completeing your task."

## Bert

- Active listener
- Can rally the team
- Coachable
- Good energy
- CSS is my favorite

- "I'm fully confident in my abilities to showcase a capable, hardworking, and trustworthy team member. I can pull my weight."

- "My weakest competencies at this time would the ones dealing with this actual craft, this skill of coding. I'm extremely weak in that regard which, in turn, affects my quality and results competencies. So I want to work on getting the help I need and asking quesitons to understand what I'm tring to learn."

- "What Carlos and Jordan said. And Jeff too."

## Conflict

- Group Consensus and communit=cation is key. If it's a technical conflict, we"ll try to keep to the 15 minute rule, and then reach out for help before it delays our preogress too much.

- For personal issues, direct communication should be upfront, but professional. Additionally, there needs to be a dialogue between the team member that is struggling and the rest of the team. There needs to be an effort to emphathise and an attempt to assist in a reasonable way. Not specifically in any issues they may personally have, but at least in the workload by assisting or leading them to the right resources to find an answer.

- With our morning briefings, we can address tasks fit to individual skill levels.

- If an individual is not pulling effort to the group project, we will talk directly and professionally. If this issue persists, we will check in at regular intervals.

## Communication Plan

- We will be available 9am to 9pm.

- We will exchange numbers, use slack, discord, and remo as necessary.

- We will check in every 90mins and take a lunch as well. Any shorter breaks we can take as necessary.

- If falling behind, we'll reach out as necessary, but we will also address anyone falling behind during our structred breaks as another regroup session.

- We end the day at 9pm on weekdays. Weekends will be situational and about small ideas, there should be zero big code talk. If there is a code breaking "emergency", then we need to work on it together via in person or via videochat. The majority of our code work will be done in class.

- We will use our briefings as a way to let everyone the opportunity to communicate.

- We are all open to hear each other without judgement and can talk about anything regarding our project.

## Work Plan

- Our daily briefings will prevent lone wolf situations.

- Keeping the big picture in mind, but seperating the workload into blocks, we can identify , assign, and be aware when they are complete. The "easier" tasks can be divided up, while the bigger aspects can be worked on together or in pairs.

- We want to put pen to paper and then translate it onto a computer, or take pictures and make sure we all have the notes we make. We can also utilize Google Drive to take notes and share it wth each other.

## Git Process

- We will have a Main branch, a working branch, individual featured branches that we are working on and the Main remains untouched.

- We are going to try using the GitHub Organization tool and share it in that manner.

- Adding protected branch that need 2 approvals for a merge.

- The creator needs to others to review the work, and upon approval, the creator will merge it.

- Once we have the MVP, it will go to Main

- The developing branch can be updated at the end of the day if the code is complete and functional.

- If you feel your code is ready, then bring it to the group and get approved before
